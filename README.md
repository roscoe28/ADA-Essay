1. A naturally curious person, I grew up wondering "why does that happen, instead of this?” Asking the question was never enough, I wanted to *know*. Early on, this drew me to the sciences.  Asking a question, developing a hypothesis, conducting tests to determine the answer or accuracy compelled and delighted me. Through completely unexpected circumstances, I later found a home in theater. I believe scientific minds find a natural home in the arts, and vice versa. The daily action of a theater artist is experimentation. Every day in rehearsal we start with a question: how do I best tell this story?  We develop theories, test them, make note of what worked and why. We select the most effective, efficient, and delightful solution. It is research, development, innovation, collaboration. All it lacks is financial security. After 20 years in the industry, and (by the standards of my industry) 20 successful years, artistic fulfillment without monetary compensation holds little allure. I am drawn to programming because it seems to combine the creative problem-solving and daily puzzle I enjoy with a fiduciary stability that I seek. So far, my exposure to programming has been reading and working through some of the jumpstart curriculum, learning to navigate github, learning markdown in preparation for this application. 

2. By the end of 2 years, I would like to be established in a sustainable career with excellent colleagues and collaborators. Five years from now, based on my previous career, I would anticipate moving into leadership and training positions in my new field. 

3. Mistakes are my bread and butter. The work I do requires me to be willing to risk error in order to discover the best solutions. If one pays attention, all those mistakes allow one to hone in on more satisfying answers. Each error offers the chance to become more attuned, more sophisticated, more facile in my work. Mistakes drive creativity and  problem-solving. Why was it a mistake? What false assumptions led me to make this mistake? How can this be adjusted for the future? Does something need to be fixed right now? How? 
You are probably not looking for a thesis on the virtue of making mistakes, but would like specific example.Two years ago I took a job teaching at a private high school in Seattle. I took the job under false assumptions about the length of the position and the values of the institution. My mistake was not doing my due diligence in understanding the culture and unspoken/unwritten rules for navigating the organization. After the term of employment ended, I researched strategies and best practices on understanding organizational culture, how to rapidly develop networks, how to negotiate, how to ask the right questions. Next time I find myself in a new environments or with new colleagues, I intend on investing strategically by immersing myself in the culture and building relationships, asking questions that will help navigate the new environment and heeding advice. 

4. My family’s response to “I don’t know how to do this” was simple: “figure it out.”  Learning and self-teaching is an extension of the impulse to understand. No matter the subject (examples: French, cooking, baking, knitting, swimming, software, riding a bike, anatomy, marketing, bookkeeping, graphic design), for me process begins with curiosity; a desire or a need to know how to do something or understand why something is the way it is. Often, the process centers around a project - a quilt for friend’s first child. I research. I skim books and read blogs, read how-to manuals. I watch videos. I go to places quilters go - fabric shops. I ask the the most competent-looking person there what they would advise. I use what I learn to set up a plan; design, shop, choose materials, clear work space, buy or borrow equipment and supplies, schedule time to do these steps. As I start cutting material, I notice none of my cuts are straight, the edges fray. I go back to the fabric shop with the competent employee and show her the squares. She explains my errors. She shows me a new technique. I return to the project and cut better squares. Then, far sooner than expected, I have a quilt. 
The process doesn’t stop there. That experience behind me, I am eager to try again, curious about how much I have retained, what I might improve, stream-line, adjust. I experiment. I design something completely unique. It has circles, applique, multiple fabric sources, it doesn't conform to any pattern. I learn, by trial and error, and by applying new knowledge, how to make it. Then, a few more. When I can throw one together with minimal effort, I feel I've learned to do it.
