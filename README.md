1.  30 counties were storm free.  
Process: I opened the file in Numbers, applied a filter to isolate all CZ_Names beginning with a vowel and deleted those rows. I then filtered for all WA state data with a CZ_Type of C (county), looked at event type and noted that all events were either heavy rains, funnel clouds, storms or flooding caused by heavy rains. There were 9 affected counties. I looked up the number of counties in WA state: there are 39. 39-9=30.  
  
2. If we can assume that all data points are wind related storms, then there were 1796 storms in 1957 during that time frame. If, however, wind related storms are only those whose even type is Tornado or Thunderstorm Wind (excluding Hail) then the answer is 1379.  
Process: I first opened the files in Numbers. I then sorted in ascending order by CZ_Name. I deleted all beginning witha  vowel. I then determined what 8am and 11pm PST would be in CST. 10:00 CST and 01:00- I noted that there were storms which began at 00:15, but no other in that first hour.   I applied a filter to isolate data for storms with a begin time not between 0101 and 0969. I then created a new column to number the range of filtered data points.   I noted the answer. Then, I filtered again by Event Type, exclude all Hail events. 
  
3. 2007 saw the most monetary impact to property and crops within the boundaries of the Lousiana Purchase. This was determined by isolating the damage in the related states and visually comparing the data. I would have prefered to have Numbers compute the data, but I could not find a way to get Numbers to treat the data as a number set due to the addition of K (thousands) and M (millions) in the data set.
