1. A naturally curious person, I grew up wondering "why does that happen, instead of this?” Asking the question was never enough, I wanted to *know*. Early on, this drew me to the sciences.  Asking a question, developing a hypothesis, conducting tests to determine the answer or accuracy compelled and delighted me. Through completely unexpected circumstances, I later found a home in theater. Every day in rehearsal we start with a question: how do I best tell this story?  We develop theories, test them, make note of what worked and why. We select the most effective, efficient, and delightful solution. It is research, development, innovation, collaboration. So, why leave all that for programming? Two things, feminism & finance. Once the purview of female coders, the industry (so the way all information gets coded and categorized), is dominated by men. I've sought to address equality via the arts, yet I'm surrounded by google auto-fill searches which assume I'm interested in losing abdominal fat and recapturing my man's interest. Whereas *my man's* auto fill assumes his interests are mortgage rates & politics. Equity cannot occur if one gender controls all the information. Secondly, financial security. Programming seems to combine the creative problem-solving and daily puzzle I enjoy with a fiduciary stability that I seek. My exposure to programming includes reading and working through the *jumpstart* curriculum, learning to navigate github,  and learning *markdown*. My experience with jumpstart and markdown has found me doing fist-pumps into the air and shouting "Yes!" to an unsuspecting coffee shop. The process of doing this application has been some the most invigorating work. I'm excited to experience more of it. 

2. By the end of 2 years, I will be established in a sustainable career with excellent colleagues and collaborators.  Five years from now, based on my previous career, I  anticipate moving into leadership and training positions in my new field. 

3. Mistakes drive creativity and  problem-solving. The work I do requires me to be willing to risk error in order to discover the best solutions. Each error offers the chance to become more attuned, more sophisticated, more facile in my work. Why was it a mistake? What false assumptions led me to make this mistake? How can this be adjusted for the future? Does something need to be fixed right now? How?  You are probably not looking for a thesis on the virtue of making mistakes, but would like specific example.Two years ago I took a job teaching at a private high school in Seattle. I took the job under false assumptions about the length of the position and the values of the institution. My mistake was not doing my due diligence in understanding the culture and unspoken/unwritten rules for navigating the organization. After the term of employment ended, I researched strategies and best practices on understanding organizational culture, how to rapidly develop networks, how to negotiate, how to ask the right questions. Next time I find myself in a new environments or with new colleagues, I intend on investing strategically by immersing myself in the culture, building relationships, asking questions that will help navigate the new environment, and heeding advice. 

4. I was born into a family of self-taught learners. The automatic response to “I don’t know how to do this” was simple: *go figure it out*.  No matter the subject (examples: French, cooking, baking, knitting, swimming, software, riding a bike, anatomy, marketing, bookkeeping, graphic design, photoshop, quark, final cut pro, scrivener), for me process begins with curiosity; a desire to know how to do something or understand why something is the way it is. Often, the process centers around a project - a quilt for friend’s first child. I research. I skim books, read blogs, and how-to manuals. I watch videos. I go to places quilters go - fabric shops. I ask the the most competent-looking person what they would advise. I use what I learn to set up a plan; design, shop, choose materials, clear work space, buy or borrow equipment, schedule the time. As I start cutting material, I notice none of my cuts are straight, the edges fray. I go back to the fabric shop with the competent employee and show her the squares. She explains my errors. She shows me a new technique. I return to the project and cut better squares. Then, far sooner than expected, I have a quilt.  The process doesn’t stop there. That experience behind me, I am eager to try again and learn more; what I might improve, stream-line, adjust. I experiment. I design something with circles, multiple fabric sources, that doesn't conform to any pattern. I learn, by trial and error, and by applying new knowledge, how to make it.
